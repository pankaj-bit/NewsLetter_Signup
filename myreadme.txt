■ Set up MainChimp Account & Obtain API Key
■ Set up the request url and headers
■ Authentication
● Look through the API documentation on authentication
Adding Success/Failure Pages to the Website
■ Instead of sending text back upon success or failure. We send back
an individual html file
■ Redirecting back to a specific page
● Method: Create a button, when pressed it will create a post
request.
● In the server, handle the post request to the location, by
redirecting to the intended page
